THIS IS MY INTERNSHIP PROJECT
PROJECT TITLE- GLOBAL SUICIDE/ HAPPINESS TRENDS

PROJECT TYPE- GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY

PROJECT SUMMARY- This project explores the World Happiness Report dataset, which ranks countries by their happiness levels based on citizen responses and well-being metrics. The core objective is to analyze the various factors influencing happiness scores globally and extract meaningful insights through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.

DESCRIPTION-

Examine social wellbeing or mental health indicators by country.

MAIN OBJECTIVE:

Highlight concerning patterns across demographics or regions

Key Objectives:

A) Load and preprocess the dataset to ensure quality analysis.

B) Investigate the distribution of the main metric, the Happiness Score, across countries and regions.

C) Examine relationships and correlations between happiness and key factors including:

Economy (GDP per Capita)

Family and Social Support

Health (Life Expectancy)

Freedom

Trust in Government (Perceptions of corruption)

Generosity

D) Detect and analyze outliers using interquartile range methods.

E) Visualize data through multiple forms such as histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, bar charts, and interactive plots to communicate findings effectively.

F) Perform regional comparisons and understand how different parts of the world differ in happiness drivers.

G) Use correlation matrices and trend analysis to highlight which factors most strongly associate with higher happiness levels.

Tools and Techniques:

A) Data handling and preparation with pandas.

B)Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn for static plots.

C) Interactive visualization using** Plotly Express** for stakeholder-friendly exploration.

D) Statistical techniques like IQR for outlier detection.

E)Correlation and regression analyses to identify key drivers of happiness.

Outcome:

A) Identified that economic prosperity (GDP per capita), social support (family), and health significantly influence happiness.

B) Demonstrated the importance of freedom and trust in government as additional contributors.

C) Provided a comprehensive EDA dashboard-like overview suitable for policy-making, academic research, or public awareness.

D) Prepared a comprehensive story around global well-being for strategic decision-making and fostering societal progress.
